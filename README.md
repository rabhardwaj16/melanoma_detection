## General Information

Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Conclusions

- Accuracy on training data has increased by using Augmentor library.
- Model is still overfitting.
- The problem of overfitting can be solved by add more layer,neurons or adding dropout layers.
- The Model can be further improved by tuning the hyperparameter.
